# NBA-players

This program goes to the NBA website and scrapes the game data for the games played over the previous days, and saves it locally (where it can be used to build predictive models etc.).

This program uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries.  Recently, there is an issue with Selenium and Chrome on an M1 mac which means it can't find the webdriver and so cannot work.  I believe that the Selenium library is being updated and so this should be fixed shortly.
